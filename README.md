## Objective
This course aims to provide the students a general introduction of data science and machine learning, with hands-on exercises and applications in mechanical system. The main topics to cover includes supervised learning problems, such as linear regressions and classifications; unsupervised learning problems such as clustering; and reinforcement learning problems. At the end of the course, the students should be equipped with basic concepts data science, and comfortable of applying them to practical problems.

## Time and location
* Lectures: Tuesday 1:10 PM ~ 3:40 PM.
* Location: Rennert Hall at Kraft Center.
* Office Hours: Thursday via Zoom

## Staffs
* Lecturer: Changyao Chen (cc2759@columbia.edu)
* TA: Xin Meng (xm2216@columbia.edu)

## Prerequisites
Linear algebra. Knowledge of basic computer programming (_e.g._, Python, Matlab, R, Java).

## Course format and grading policy
The course will delivered as a series of 2.5-hour long lectures. The grading will be 60% homework, and 40% final project. There will be in total 4 homework (HW) assignments, which are due throughout the course. The final project will be a group-based, 5-minute presentation of a selected topic (details TBD).

**Classification**: Logistic regression. Maximum likelihood estimation.

**Gradient descent**: Gradient descent: batch, stochastic, mini-batch.

**Regularization. Feature selection. Dimension reduction**: Overfitting, cross-validation and bootstrap. Best subset, forward, backward selection. L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. Revisit of SVD. Principle Component Analysis.

**Tree-based models**: Single decision tree with recursive binary splitting approach. Bagging, Random Forest and Boosting.

**Neural Networks**: Feed-forward Neural Networks (NN). Back propagation. Introduction of Convolutional NN and Recurrent NN.
