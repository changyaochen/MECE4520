## Objective
This course aims to provide the students a general introduction of data science and machine learning, with hands-on exercises and applications in mechanical system. The main topics to cover includes supervised learning problems, such as linear regressions and classifications; unsupervised learning problems such as clustering; and reinforcement learning problems. At the end of the course, the students should be equipped with basic concepts data science, and comfortable of applying them to practical problems.

## Time and location
* Lectures: Monday and Wednesday, 8:40am-9:55am.
* Location: 417 International Affairs Building.
* Office Hours: TBD.

## Staffs
* Lecturer: Changyao Chen (cc2759@columbia.edu).
* TA: Yuhang Hu (yh3187@columbia.edu).

## Prerequisites
Linear algebra. Knowledge of basic computer programming (_e.g._, Python, Matlab, R, Java).

## Course format and grading policy
The course will delivered as a series of 2.5-hour long lectures. The grading will be 60% homework, and 40% final project. There will be in total 4 homework (HW) assignments, which are due throughout the course. The final project will be a group-based, 5-minute presentation of a selected topic (details TBD).
